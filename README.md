# Lead-Score-Case-Study

## Problem Statement :

X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.
Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos.When 
these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the 
company also gets leads through past referrals. 

Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, 
some of the leads get converted while most do not.The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 

## Business Goal :

X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying 
customers. 

The company needs a model wherein you a lead score is assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead 
score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. 

The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
